# Libftasm

About
-----
> This project aims to have us encode a mini-lib in ASM, recoding some basic functions of libc.
>
> At the end of this project we will be familiar with the syntax of the language, the operation of the stack, but also the behavior of the compiler.
>
> Absolutely essential to continue on security projects.
